 ### Introduction 
 
 This GitHub project provides a comprehensive guide and a set of resources to create and manage infrastructure using Terraform and automate the deployment process using GitHub Actions. 
 
 Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and provision infrastructure using a declarative configuration language. 
 
 Whereas GitHub Actions is a powerful automation and CI/CD platform provided by GitHub.

 
By combining Terraform and GitHub Actions, you can:

**Define Infrastructure as Code**: Define your infrastructure components, such as virtual machines, databases, and networks, in a Terraform configuration file.

**Automate Deployment**: Set up GitHub Actions workflows to automatically deploy your infrastructure whenever there are changes to your Terraform configuration.

**Version Control**: Keep your infrastructure code version-controlled and easily collaborate with your team.

**Infrastructure as Code Best Practices**: Follow best practices for infrastructure as code, including versioning, code review, and documentation.

This project serves as a starting point for your infrastructure automation journey, providing a basic structure and guidelines to build upon.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

* GitHub Account
* Terraform installed on your local machine.
* Access to a cloud provider account (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) and necessary API credentials.
