# VPC-Terraform-GitHub-Action

## Create and Manage infrastructure using Terraform as IAAC and automate the deployment process with GitHub Actions as CICD.

![Project Flow](https://github.com/gauri17-pro/vpc-terraform-github-actions/assets/60473255/0e09102c-2949-4576-be43-39900a2c1a95)
 
 ### Introduction 
 
 This GitHub project provides a comprehensive guide and a set of resources to create and manage infrastructure using Terraform and automate the deployment process using GitHub Actions. 
 
 Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and provision infrastructure using a declarative configuration language. 
 
 Whereas GitHub Actions is a powerful automation and CI/CD platform provided by GitHub.

 
By combining Terraform and GitHub Actions, you can:

**Define Infrastructure as Code**: Define your infrastructure components, such as virtual machines, databases, and networks, in a Terraform configuration file.

**Automate Deployment**: Set up GitHub Actions workflows to automatically deploy your infrastructure whenever there are changes to your Terraform configuration.

**Version Control**: Keep your infrastructure code version-controlled and easily collaborate with your team.

**Infrastructure as Code Best Practices**: Follow best practices for infrastructure as code, including versioning, code review, and documentation.

This project serves as a starting point for your infrastructure automation journey, providing a basic structure and guidelines to build upon.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

* GitHub Account
* Terraform installed on your local machine.
* Access to a cloud provider account (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) and necessary API credentials.

### ðŸš€ Project Overview: Deploying Infrastructure as Code with Terraform and GitHub Actions

Iâ€™m excited to share my recent project where I implemented Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform, enhanced with CI/CD capabilities via GitHub Actions. This project focuses on setting up a secure, scalable, and fully functional cloud architecture on AWS. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive overview:

#### **ðŸ”§ Key Components:**

1. **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):**
   - Created a custom VPC to isolate our resources and ensure secure communication between instances.

2. **Subnets:**
   - Configured public and private subnets for efficient resource management and enhanced security. Public subnets host external-facing resources, while private subnets house databases and internal applications.

3. **Internet Gateway:**
   - Attached an Internet Gateway to the VPC to facilitate internet access for resources in public subnets.

4. **Route Tables:**
   - Defined route tables to control the traffic flow between subnets and the internet, ensuring proper routing of requests.

5. **EC2 Instances:**
   - Launched EC2 instances for application deployment in both public and private subnets, optimizing for performance and security.

6. **Application Load Balancer (ALB):**
   - Set up an Application Load Balancer to distribute incoming traffic across EC2 instances for enhanced availability and redundancy.

#### **ðŸ”„ CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions:**

- **Automation of Deployment:**
  - Implemented a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate the deployment of Terraform configurations.
  - The pipeline includes steps for validating Terraform code, planning changes, and applying updates to the infrastructure seamlessly.

- **Benefits of Automation:**
  - Streamlined the process of deploying changes, reducing manual intervention and the risk of human errors.
  - Facilitated a faster development lifecycle, enabling rapid iterations on infrastructure and applications.

#### **ðŸ“ˆ Benefits of Using Terraform and GitHub Actions:**

- **Scalability:**
  - Terraform enables easy scaling of resources based on varying demand.
  
- **Version Control:**
  - Managing infrastructure code in GitHub allows for version tracking and collaboration among team members.

- **Consistency:**
  - Ensured consistent and repeatable deployments across different environments (dev, staging, production).

#### **ðŸ’¡ Final Thoughts:**

This project not only reinforced my skills in cloud architecture and DevOps practices but also highlighted the importance of automation in modern software development. I look forward to building more sophisticated solutions and sharing my learnings with the community.
